// This is a Node.js script to reorganize components
// It would move files to their appropriate folders
// For example:
// - Move google-calendar-integration.tsx to google-calendar/calendar-integration.tsx
// - Move shared-workout-card.tsx and shared-workout-display.tsx to workouts/
// - Move revenue-chart.tsx and quick-stats.tsx to dashboard/
// - etc.

// This is just a placeholder for the script that would be run manually
// In a real project, you would implement this script to automate the reorganization
